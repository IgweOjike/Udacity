    <p><strong> ***Breaking News: AlphaGo has won the first two matches!***</strong> In this, the third in our series on the epic Go matches being played between AlphaGo (Google’s Artificial Intelligence software) and Lee Se-Dol (Current Go World Champion),
        we look at the history of Humans vs. Machines, and the innovations that have led us to this incredible moment in time.

    <p>For as long as humans have built things, we’ve wrestled with the implications of what we’ve built. In many cases, these philosophical and ethical wrestlings have made for great drama—think Frankenstein, or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Often, the hypothetical
        scenarios we envision come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we’ve made in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning make clear that a “computer with a mind of its own” is going to take over the world not such a fantastic
        thing to imagine any longer.</p>
    <h1>The Triumph of Deep Blue</h1>
    <p>Perhaps this is why we are so captivated by human vs. machine competitions, because the idea of being overcome by that which we’ve created speaks to something very deep within our collective consciousness. When IBM’s Deep Blue faced off against Garry
        Kasparov1, the event resulted in more than [three billion impressions](http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/deepblue/) around the world, and when IBM’s later creation Watson challenged the champions on Jeopardy, millions of viewers
        were glued to the proceedings.
